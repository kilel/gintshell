What do you need to launch gintshell?
=
1)JRE 1.7

2)Eclipse IDE. 

2)Scilab with correct settings (http://help.scilab.org/docs/5.4.0/en_US/compile_and_run_javasci_v2.html)
LD_LIBRARY_PATH and SCI environment variables are had to be imported to launch configuration, 
and native libraries must be attached to scilab jars. 

Tested in kubuntu 12.10 (scilab 5.4.1).  Still can not launch over windows (damn scilab settings)
